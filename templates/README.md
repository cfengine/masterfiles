# systemd service file templates for CFEngine

These are based on files at core/misc/systemd and are available as a
starting point for those who wish to manage systemd configuration with cfengine.

They are used if the class `mpf_enable_cfengine_systemd_component_management` is defined.
NOTE: Any changes made here should be synchronized with core/misc/systemd files.
