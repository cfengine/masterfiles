# Changelog
Notable changes to the framework should be documented here

## [Unreleased][unreleased]
### Added
 - CHANGELOG.md
 - Support for user specified overring of framework defaults without modifying
   policy supplied by the framework itself (see example_def.json)

### Changed
 - Relocate def.cf to controls/VER/
 - Re-organize cfe_internal splitting core from enterprise specific policies
   and loading the appropriate inputs only when necessary
 - Moved update directory into cfe_internal as it is not generally intended to
   be modified
 - services/autorun.cf moved to lib/VER/ as it is not generally intended to be
   modified
 - To improve predictibility autorun bundles are activated in lexicographical
   order
 - Relocate services/file_change.cf to cfe_internal/enterprise. This policy is
   most useful for a good OOTB experience with CFEngine Enterprise Mission
   Portal.
 - Relocate service_catalogue from promsies.cf to
   services/service_catalogue.cf. It is intended to be a user entry.

### Deprecated

### Removed
 - Diff reporting on /etc/shadow (Enterprise)
 - Update policy from promise.cf inputs. There is no reason to include the
   update policy into promsies.cf, update.cf is the entry for the update policy

### Fixed

### Security
