# CFEngine Community Open Promise-Body Library
#
# This initiative started by CFEngine promotes a
# standardized set of names and promise specifications
# for template functionality within CFEngine 3.
#
# The aim is to promote an industry standard for
# naming of configuration patterns, leading to a
# de facto middleware of standardized syntax.
#
# Names should be intuitive and parameters should be
# minimal to assist readability and comprehensibility.
