Run this generator and redirect the output to the resulting policy file.

Only use python3.

python3 the_great_package_test_generator.py > the_great_package_test.cf

There should be minimal changes depending on what you changed in the generator.

If there is a lot of unexpected change that you didn't intend, try a different
version of python3 and document here which one to use.
